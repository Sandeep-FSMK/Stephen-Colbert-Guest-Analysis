Data Gathering and Preparation

I have taken the data from wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Late_Show_with_Stephen_Colbert_episodes . I have used two programs for the data extraction Talkshow_Data notebook to scrape and clean data. This creates two CSV files. episode_details.csv and guest_details.csv.Basic wrangling and cleaning of the data is done in the notebook Talkshow_Data. episode_details.csv contains the individual episode details and guest_details.csv contains guest name and wikipedia link of the guest name. After that guest_details.csv undergoes some kind of cleaning steps to make the names standardized. For e.g in some places name wil be 'Vice President Joe Biden' but some episodes it would be 'Joe Biden'.These data cleaning was done manually and the new file is guest_details_01.csv

guest_details_01.csv will be the input for the next program profile_data. This program goes to the each record from guest details csv and pull out following information from the personal wikipedia page

1.Name 2.Age 3.Country born 4.State Born 5.City Born 6.Nationality 7.Almamater 8.Education 9.Occupation 10.Political party

It creates a CSV file called profile_details.csv.

profile_details.csv goes through various manual wrangling phases like filling in the missing information which program couldn't fetch from the wikipedia and correcting the formats. I have also used Tableau Prep to split the fields, identify duplicates. A short summary of the wrangling phases . I have preserved the files if some one is intereseted to go through the wrangling process

These are the versions *
profile_details_01.csv - Cleaned the Occupation and Education categories in such a way that it can be read as a python list . Because of the non standard format of wikipedia data ,the downloaded data wasn't in a proper format. Manually checked the nationalities and cleaned up State , City and Country fields .

profile_details_02.csv - Added Gender field manually . And deleted some more duplicates

profile_details_03.csv - Splitted Education and Almamater fields to handle multiple values

profile_details_04.csv - Categorized different occupations to 7 groups for the sake of clarity and analysis

profile_details_05.csv - Created universities.csv from education and almamater fields and removed those fields from this file . Data_Cleaning program has been used for this . Also cross checked political affiliations.

The biggest challenge I have faced in data cleaning was the non uniform structure of the wikipedia data. It made it almost impossible to do certain wrangling programmitaclly.

Analysis

Much of the analysis and visualization has been done in Tableau and I have used profile_details_05.csv for this. I have included Tableau worksheet Medium_Post.twbx in this repository. In the program Data_Cleaning I have done some statistical analysis of the variable age.
